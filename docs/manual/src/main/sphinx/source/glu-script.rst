|script-logo| glu script
========================
A glu script is a set of instructions backed by a state machine that the agent knows how to run. In general, and by default, a glu script represents the set of instructions which defines the lifecycle of what it means to ``install``, ``configure``, ``start``, ``stop``, ``unconfigure`` and ``uninstall`` an application.

Groovy Class
------------

A glu script is a groovy class which contains a set of closures where the name of each :term:`closure` matches the name of the actions defined in the state machine. This example shows the default closure names. The script can also store state in attributes (like ``port`` and ``pid`` in this example). 

.. tip:: The code of each closure can be any arbitrary groovy/java code but remember that the agent offers :ref:`some capabilities <agent-capabitites>` to help you in writing more concise code.

State machine
-------------
Each glu script is backed by a state machine which is an instance of ``org.linkedin.groovy.util.state.StateMachine`` (`StateMachine api <https://github.com/linkedin/linkedin-utils/blob/master/org.linkedin.util-groovy/src/main/groovy/org/linkedin/groovy/util/state/StateMachine.groovy>`_). The default state machine is the following:

This is how the default state machine is defined.

   :alt: State Machine Definition

You can define your own state machine by defining a static attribute called ``stateMachine``

This is how the ``AutoUpgradeScript`` (`AutoUpgradeScript source <https://github.com/linkedin/glu/blob/master/agent/org.linkedin.glu.agent-impl/src/main/groovy/org/linkedin/glu/agent/impl/script/AutoUpgradeScript.groovy>`_) glu script defines different states and actions::

    class AutoUpgradeScript {
      def static stateMachine =
      [
          NONE: [ [to: 'installed', action: 'install'] ],
          installed: [ [to: 'NONE', action: 'uninstall'], [to: 'prepared', action: 'prepare'] ],
          prepared: [ [to: 'upgraded', action: 'commit'], [to: 'installed', action: 'rollback'] ],
          upgraded: [ [to: 'NONE', action: 'uninstall'] ]
      ]
      ...
   }

The minimum (usefull) state machine that you can define could look like::

    def static stateMachine =
    [
        NONE: [ [to: 'running', action: 'start'] ],
        running: [ [to: 'NONE', action: 'stop'] ]
    ]

.. note:: If an action is empty you don't even have to define its equivalent action but you still need to call all prior actions to satisfy the state machine.

Capabilities
------------
As described in the section :ref:`agent-capabitites`, a glu script can use all the capabilities provided by the agent.

.. tip:: 
   Implicitely (at runtime), all glu scripts implement the `GluScript <https://github.com/linkedin/glu/blob/master/agent/org.linkedin.glu.agent-impl/src/main/groovy/org/linkedin/glu/agent/impl/GluScript.groovy>`_ interface.

Conventions
-----------

Logs
^^^^
In order to be able to see (in the console) log files produced by an application deployed by the glu script, you can follow the convention described in the ":ref:`console-script-log-files`" section.

Fields
^^^^^^
All fields in a glu script are stored (locally on the agent) and exported (remotely to ZooKeeper). Check the ":ref:`agent-integration-zookeeper`" section.

Real life example
-----------------
You can find a real life example of a glu script called `JettyGluScript <https://github.com/linkedin/glu/blob/master/scripts/org.linkedin.glu.script-jetty/src/main/groovy/JettyGluScript.groovy>`_ which shows how to deploy a webapp container (jetty), install web applications in it and monitor it.
