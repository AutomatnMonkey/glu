Introduction
============
GLU is a deployment automation platform. It has been built and deployed at LinkedIn in early 2010
and then released as open source in November 2010. The goal is to be able to automate the
deployment of any kind of applications accross many nodes. Although written in groovy/java, the
type of applications that can be deployed through GLU is not limited to java applications. GLU is
a platform and the way it was architected and designed allows you to pick and choose which part you 
want to use... Check the docs folder (and soon the wiki) for more documentation on GLU.
